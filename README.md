# Pong Game Project in Unreal Engine 5

## Overview

This repository contains a Pong game project implemented in Unreal Engine 5 with C++. This project serves as a learning exercise for me to familiarize myself with various aspects of game development including, but not limited to, AI programming, game physics, and UE5 features.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5.
3. Build and run the project to launch the game.

## Important Note on Audio Content

The project as uploaded does not include the audio assets due to licensing restrictions. The sounds used in the original project can be purchased from the Unreal Engine Marketplace via the following link: [Retro 8bit Sounds](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/retro-8bit-sounds).

If you wish to run this project locally, you have two options:

1. Purchase the sound pack and include the audio files in the appropriate directories.
2. Remove or comment out any references to `PlaySound` functions in the codebase to avoid compilation errors.

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay.
- AI opponent with basic ball tracking and path prediction.
- Score tracking and win conditions.

## License

This project is for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial use. Please refer to the individual licenses for any third-party assets used within the project.

## Contributions

As this is a learning project, contributions or suggestions are always welcome!
